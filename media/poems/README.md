## Where to Store Your Poem Images

Place your poem images in this folder:
`public/media/poems/`

## How to Add Poems

1. **Save your poem images** (photos of written poems, designed poem graphics, etc.) in this folder
2. **Update the code** in `src/pages/ExtraCurricular.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   const poems = ["poem1.jpg", "poem2.jpg", "poem3.png"];
   ```
